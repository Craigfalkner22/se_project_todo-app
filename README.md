# Simple Todo App

My project is a simple Todo list that can add or remove activities that need to be done to with a daue date on when they need to be done.

## Functionality

This project's functionality is based around JavaScript mostly and you can add new items to the list, edit the list via adding or removing items, and it has been coded to add due dates for when those items need to be done.
Whenever you click Add Todo you can add any item that you want done to the list.
The list also has a checkbox feature that allows you to check off the completed items on the list rather than deleting them so you can track your progress on all of your current Todos'
There is also a delete option just incase you want to remove a task that you feel is no longer necessary.

## Technology

The technology that was used was Html just to make the basic structure of the page.
Css was used to just make out how to the styles of the forums and page its self.
The real magic is the JavaScript that used on the page.
JavaScript was used to make out current Todos that load up on the page when the webpage first goes live. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x4cs8McUqhBTBwbOiiNTIBdELM509Tzd/view?usp=sharing
Also for adding and removing items from the Todo list JavaScript was used. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yQheacMEpnDK-Ly359qlu4g0TZNqKjSl/view?usp=sharing
The modal that pops up when you go to add a item to the list is the magic of JavaScript. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kzyzR8Gcxorb80rijMIp-WGEUIcYXnzv/view?usp=sharing
All the errors are the work of JavaScript and also when the errors are removed from the form being valid is the work of JavaScript. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rSlNYwBOy8lSNE3BLC73GRPl8XWiYDEG/view?usp=sharing
The checkbox was also a work of a little JavaScript magic. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q7w-kEmJ24dS_UToIn8PHt6ZtuLOfz6Y/view?usp=sharing
